Caesar cipher

Caesar cipher is simply a right-shift along the alphabet by the number of letters indicated by the key parameter.
The main() method has a good example.

Implement the String decode(StringReader reader, int key) method.
The method receives encoded data.
It must return the decrypted string stored in the StringReader.
Under no circumstances should null be returned.
The main() method is not tested.


Requirements:
1. The Solution class must have a String decode(StringReader reader, int key) method.
2. The decode(StringReader reader, int key) method must return the decrypted string stored in the StringReader.
3. Under no circumstances should null be returned.
