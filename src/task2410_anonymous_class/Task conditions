Be sure that the getIterator method returns an anonymous class.
Transfer the LocalIterator logic to an anonymous class.
Only change the body of the getIterator method.

Requirements:

•	The object returned by the getIterator method must be an instance of an anonymous class.
•	The program should display data on the screen.
•	The behavior of the program should remain the same.
