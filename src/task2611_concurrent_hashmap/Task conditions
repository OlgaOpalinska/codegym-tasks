Analyze ConcurrentHashMap.
In a separate file, create a Producer class that will:
1. every half second, add a key and value to a ConcurrentHashMap, where the key is the counter starting from 1, and the value is a phrase like "Some text for i", e.g. "Some text for 1".
2. when an exception occurs, display the following: "[THREAD_NAME] thread was terminated", e.g. "[thread-1] thread was terminated".


Requirements:
1. The Producer class must be in a separate file.
2. The Producer class must implement the Runnable interface.
3. The Producer class must contain a private ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map field.
4. The Producer class must have a constructor with one parameter that initializes the map field.
5. The Producer class's run() method must add a key and a value to the ConcurrentHashMap every half second according to the task conditions.
6. When an exception occurs, the Producer class's run() method should display "[THREAD_NAME] thread was terminated".
