# codegym-tasks
My solutions of some CodeGym tasks.

In here I'm keeping some interesting tasks which I managed to complete throughout my CodeGym course. 
I will come back every once in a while and analyze them, maybe change the code for more efficient as I find out new ways to solve old problems.

Some of the tasks will have a lot of comments that may look unnecessary. It is because I want to keep track of how was my understanding of code at that specific time.
